<p>To verify the existence of a real link, use the view of CouchDB.</p>

<h3>Shorten logic</h3>
<p>Now for generate short uud uses a couchDB uuid generator, from a long uuid the short uuid is computed,
and is encoded from the hexagonal to Alfabet 58 characters.

<p>
If a document with such a uuid already exists, then we will create a document with a different short uuid generated
    from the second uuid, which we received from the CouchDB uuid generator.
